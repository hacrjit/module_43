    "Statistics is a branch of mathematics that deals with collecting, analyzing, interpreting, presenting, and organizing data. It involves the use of mathematical and computational tools to gain insights from data and make informed decisions. Statistics is widely used in various fields such as science, business, economics, engineering, and social sciences to summarize and analyze data, test hypotheses, and make predictions based on data."

    "Understanding the level of measurement is important when analyzing data because it determines the types of statistical analyses that can be applied to the data and the meaningful interpretations that can be made. Using the wrong level of measurement or treating a variable as a different level can lead to incorrect conclusions and misleading interpretations.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider a dataset containing the heights of students in a class and their eye colors. Height is a ratio variable because it has a natural zero point and equal intervals between values. On the other hand, eye color is a nominal variable because it is categorical and has no inherent order.\n",

    "If we were to mistakenly treat eye color as an ordinal variable and try to calculate the mean eye color of the students, it would not make sense because there is no meaningful way to rank eye colors. Similarly, if we were to treat height as an ordinal variable and calculate the mode height, it would not provide useful information because the intervals between height categories are not meaningful in an ordinal scale.\n",

    "   - Example: The range of temperatures recorded in a city over a week.\n",
    "2. Variance: The variance measures the average squared difference of each value from the mean. It gives an idea of how much the values in a dataset vary from the mean.\n",
    "   - Example: The variance of test scores in a class.\n",
    "3. Standard Deviation: The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It provides a measure of the dispersion of the data points around the mean.\n",
